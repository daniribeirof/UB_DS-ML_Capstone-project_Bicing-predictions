Repository for Capstone Project of Daniela and Nathalia, part of the Postgraduate course in Data Science and Machine Learning, at Universitat de Barcelona.


The **Bicing**, the bike sharing system of Barcelona, has more than 500 stations and it is a common transport option for local people.

Despite being a great transport option in the city, users face some problems on a daily basis.
One of the problems is that, with a limited number of bikes and docks, it is sometimes difficult to find available bikes or available free slots to return the bike at the end of the trip.

In this work, we will study the behavior of users over the years, months, days of the week, and make a model to predict the system availability, given the bike station and the time. These predictions can help riders better plan their trips and help the service more efficiently distribute bikes to stations.

The final result is the percentage of free docks for each of the proposed stations given historical data.
